The controller is based on various papers, most important ones are

[Highly Dynamic Quadruped Locomotion via Whole-Body Impulse Control and Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.065860)
This paper proposed the overall control architecture.

Furthermore [Implementation of a Reactive Walking Controller for the Solo12](https://hal.laas.fr/hal-03591735/document) proposed a more computational efficient way of the whole body controller, that made is possible to run it on an [Up squared Pro](https://up-board.org/up-squared-pro/), a tiny  Intel-based board.

Finally  [leziart2022_Improved_Control_Scheme_Solo_Quadruped](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561559) integraded a dynamic consideration of the moving legs in the whole body controller allowing a higher speed.
