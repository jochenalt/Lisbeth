Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
===============================

The IMU is the source of the entire pipeline, therefore it is needs to be very fast as the pipeline is supposed to work with a decent frequency. Most hobby IMUs go up to 100Hz, which is okay, but above that things quickly get expensive. Heavy hearted I went with the `Lord Microstrain 3DM-CV5 IMU <https://www.microstrain.com/inertial-sensors/3dm-cv5-10>`_. Don't even ask.


Wiring the IMU
------------------

All Microstrain IMUs have this annoying 1.27mm IDC socket, which is hard to source. I used a `IDC(SWT) cable <https://www.adafruit.com/product/1675>`_ from Adafruit, cut off one end and connected it to a regular 5-pin JST XH connector:

The pins in the column "IMU", are coming from the  `IMUs User Manual <https://www.microstrain.com/sites/default/files/3dm-cv5-10_user_manual_8500-0074_1.pdf>`_, they specify the pins of the IMUs 2x5 IDC socket. The column PIN denotes the number of the JST socket.

Before the IMU can be used, baud rate, frequency, and message format have to be defined. The manufacturer provides a tool called `Sensor Connect  <https://www.microstrain.com/software/sensorconnect>` for this, and a regular UART to USB adapter is used to connect it. (It is done only once, so it is perfectly okay to use flying wires like this)

After pluging in, Sensorconnect should be able to connect to the device with the default baud rate of 115200. Some settings need to be done, at 1000Hz we need 916200 baud having in mind that one data packet is 48 bytes:

As message format coming from the IMU we need ther acceleration, the gyro, and the delta velocity (for the linear acceleration):

Finally, we need to define this as startup settings:

And the data streaming should start right away after startup:
