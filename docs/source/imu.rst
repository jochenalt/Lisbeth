IMU
===

The IMU is the source of the entire pipeline, and it is especially important since it determines the frequency the robot's control algorithm. Most hobby  IMU go up to 100Hz, but above that things quickly get expensive. Heavy hearted I went with the [Lord Microstrain 3DM-CV5 IMU](https://www.microstrain.com/inertial-sensors/3dm-cv5-10) which I got from ebay, sometimes these lucky things happen.
