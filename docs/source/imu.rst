Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
===============================

The IMU is the source of the entire pipeline, therefore it is needs to be very fast, if the pipeline is supposed to work with a decent frequency. Most hobby  IMU go up to 100Hz, which is okay, but above that things quickly get expensive. Heavy hearted I went with the `Lord Microstrain 3DM-CV5 IMU <https://www.microstrain.com/inertial-sensors/3dm-cv5-10>`_. Don't even ask.
